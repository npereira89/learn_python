#In this exercise, your task is to create a Python function named is_perfect_number that checks whether a given integer 
#is a perfect number or not. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding itself.
#A classic example of a perfect number is 6. Let's break it down:
#Positive divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. 
#However, when checking if a number is perfect, we exclude the number itself. So, for our purposes, the divisors are 1, 2, and 3.
#When you sum these divisors, you get 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is the original number. Therefore, 6 is a perfect number.
