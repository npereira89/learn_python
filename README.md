In my repository, you can find a solution, but there are others. There are some exercises from [programming 24 from MOOC](https://programming-24.mooc.fi/) ***(introduction part)***;

* **get_a_number_game.py**: In this script, I did a game to figure out a number between 1 a 100. Just have 3 attempts. I give some clues. In the end of the 3 attempts, I told you the number sorted. Is it fun? Let's play!;

```
**To upgrade Instaloader to its current version, do:**
```
    pip3 install --upgrade instaloader
```
**Alternative methods for installing Instaloader:**

If you do not want to use pip, even though it is highly recommended, and prefer to install Instaloader manually, Download the Source, extract the Zip or Tarball and run setup.py from there.

** On Arch Linux, you may install Instaloader using the Instaloader AUR package.
** On Windows 10, you may download the standalone executable from the current release page.
** On Android, you can use Instaloader with Termux after typing pkg install python and pip3 install instaloader.
** To test the most current pre-release version of Instaloader:
```
    pip3 install --pre instaloader
```
> [!WARNING]
> The use of those Instagram scripts, could result in temporarily IP address banned to login in your Instagram account. Beware, when you use it. Probably you'll get an error 404, 401 but it's normal because you are using an Graph API. **In future, I will update those scripts you Graph.**
